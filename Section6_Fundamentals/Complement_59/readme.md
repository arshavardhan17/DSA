# 🔁 Complement of Base-10 Integer (Bitwise)

This project demonstrates how to compute the **bitwise complement** of a **base-10 integer** using efficient bitwise operations in Java.

---

## 🧠 What is the Bitwise Complement?

The **bitwise complement** of a number is calculated by flipping all its bits (0 ➝ 1 and 1 ➝ 0) **only for the bits used to represent the number**.

### Example:
```

Input: 5 (in binary: 101)
Mask: 7 (in binary: 111)
Output: 2 (in binary: 010)

````

We ignore leading zeroes and only flip the meaningful bits.

## 🧮 Formula / Logic

To get the complement of `n`:
1. If `n == 0`, return 1 (special case).
2. Create a mask with all bits set to 1 of the same length as `n`'s binary.
3. Use XOR: `n ^ mask`.

## 💻 Java Code

```java
package Section6_Fundamentals.Complement_59;

public class Main {

    // Method to compute bitwise complement
    public static int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        int number = n;
        int mask = 0;

        // Create mask with all bits set to 1 up to the most significant bit
        while (number != 0) {
            mask = (mask << 1) | 1;
            number = number >> 1;
        }

        // XOR with mask to flip bits
        return n ^ mask;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = bitwiseComplement(5);
        System.out.println("Bitwise complement of 5 is: " + result);
    }
}
````

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
Bitwise complement of 5 is: 2
```

## ⚙️ Time & Space Complexity

| Operation        | Complexity |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(log n)   |
| Space Complexity | O(1)       |
